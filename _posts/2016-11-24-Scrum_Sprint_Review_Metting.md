At the end of each sprint a Sprint Review meeting is held. Scrum Team shows which Scrum Product Backlog items they completed (according to the Definition of Done) during the sprint. This might take place in the form of a **demo** of the new features.

Incomplete items/remaining activities shall be taken back into the Scrum Product Backlog, re-estimated and completed in one of the following sprints.

Scrum Product Owner inspects the implemented backlog entries and accepts the solution or adds new stories to the Scrum Product Backlog to adapt the functionality.

----------

The Sprint Review meeting should be kept very informal:

- No PowerPoint slides

- Time for preparation and performing the meeting should be limited.

----------

Participants in the sprint review typically include:

- Scrum Product Owner

- Scrum Team

- Scrum Master

- Additionally management, customers, and developers from other projects might participate as well.
