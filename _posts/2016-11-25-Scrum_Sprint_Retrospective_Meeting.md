Scrum Team and the Scrum Master get together for the Sprint Retrospective after the Sprint Review meeting. This metting is an integral part of “**inspect and adapt**” process. 

In this meeting all team members reflect on the past sprint and check three things:

1. What went well during the sprint

2. What didn't

3. What improvements could be made in the next sprint.

The meeting should be time-boxed (e.g. 3 hours).
