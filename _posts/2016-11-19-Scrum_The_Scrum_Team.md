A Scrum Team is a collection of individuals working together to deliver the requested and committed product increments.

## Characteristics of a Scrum Team ##

- Team members share the same norms and rules (具相同規範)

- The Scrum team as a whole is accountable for the delivery (負責交付)

- The Scrum Team is empowered (具有權力)

- It is working as autonomous as it is possible

- The Scrum Team is self organizing

- The skills within the Scrum team are balanced (彼此能力是平衡的)

- A Scrum Team is small and has no sub-teams (The ideal size is 7 +/- 2 people)

- The people within the Scrum Team work full time in the team

- People are collocated (互相配合)

## Rules & Norms ##

- Time and location of the Daily Scrum Meeting

- The Definition Of Done (DoD) used to decide if work is finished or not

- Coding guidelines

- Tools to use

## Accountability ##

- Responsible to deliver the committed delivery in time and with the defined quality

- Never attributed to a single team member but always the result of the Scrum Team.

## Empowered to define ##

- What it will commit to deliver at the end of the sprint

- How the expected results have to be broken down into tasks

- Who will perform the task and in which order they are performed

## Responsibilities of the Scrum Team ##

- They have to **breakdown the requirements**, **create task**, **estimate** and **distribute** them. In other words this means that they have to **create the Sprint Backlog**.

- They have to perform the short Daily Sprint Meeting.

- They have to ensure that at the end of the Sprint potentially shippable functionality is delivered.
 
- They have to **update the status** and the **remaining efforts** for their tasks to allow creation of a Sprint Burndown Diagram.
