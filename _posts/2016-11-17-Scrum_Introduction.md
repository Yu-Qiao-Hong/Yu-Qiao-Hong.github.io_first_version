Scrum is a **agile** project management framework used for software development.

The Scrum Framework implements the cornerstones defined by the agile manifesto:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools (個人與互動 重於 流程與工具)

- Working software over comprehensive documentation (可用的軟體 重於 詳盡的文件)

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (與客戶合作 重於 合約協商)

- Responding to change over following a plan (回應變化 重於 遵循計劃)

----------

## Scrum three roles ##
