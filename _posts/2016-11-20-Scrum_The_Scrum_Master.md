The Scrum Master is part of the Scrum Team and acts as a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. To get the required trust the Scrum Master should have no line-management responsibility for one of the team members. Otherwise the necessary open communication and decision finding will be hampered.

## Responsibilities of the Scrum Master ##

- Guard the Scrum Team from external requests and disruptions (保護組員不讓外部需求打斷組員)

- Act as a change agent and adapt processes to maximize productivity of the team (適時調整讓組員有最高產出)

- Coach the Scrum Team

- Remove impediments for the Scrum Team (幫助成員消除障礙)

- Ensure efficient communication between the Scrum Team and the Scrum Product Owner (作為PO與成員的溝通橋梁)

- Facilitate the various Scrum Events (協助scrum的進行)

## Guarding the Scrum Team / Removing impediments ##

- To guard the team members from "urgent requests".

- To discuss such requests and to either postpone the request until the next sprint starts or to cancel the current sprint and start-over.

- Helps by removing impediments that block or hinder development. Examples could be organizing meetings, clarifying questions or performing supporting work.

## Change agent ##

- Continuously improvement through inspect & adapt.

- Hosts the Scrum Retrospective Meeting and then to facilitate the change of the identified shortcomings.

## Facilitation of Scrum Events ##

- Daily Scrum Meetings

- Sprint Planning Meetings

- Sprint Review Meetings

- Sprint Retrospective Meeting
