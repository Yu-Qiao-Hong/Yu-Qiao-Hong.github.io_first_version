一個class只專心做一件事。

# Open Closed Principle (OCP)#

**開放封閉原則**

> software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)#

**Liskov 替換原則**

> Inheritance should ensure that any property proved about supertype objects also holds for subtype objects

# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)#

**介面隔離原則**

# Dependency inversion principle (DIP)#
