The daily Scrum meeting is a short everyday meeting, ideally during start of the working day. Each team member should briefly provide the answers of the following three questions:

- What has he/she accomplished since the last daily Scrum meeting? (昨天完成了什麼)

- What is he/she is going to accomplish until the next Scrum meeting? (今天打算做什麼)

- What are the impediments that prevent he/she from accomplishing his/her tasks? (是否有碰到阻礙或困難)

All team members should attend and they should stand during the meeting. The daily Scrum meeting should ideally **not last more than 15 minutes**. Issues or concerns raised during the meeting ought to be **recorded by the Scrum Master** and needs to be specifically handled **after the meeting**.
